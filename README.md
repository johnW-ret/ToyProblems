ToyProblems
===

This is a repository consisting of answers and explanations to potential interview questions and novel computer science problems.

The purpose of this repository is not to provide a comprehensive collection of "prep work" nor to discover the most optimal solution to a problem, but to store and organize solutions I come up with that I find interesting so that I don't lose them. As such,
- the organization and structure of this repository is subject to change
- while the average problem is meant to be a novel or "bite-sized" programming problem which are common in interviews, you may find problems unlikely to appear on any interview

# Table of Contents

  [Polyglot Notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/polyglot). Loosely organized by topic, for example
  
  - strings.ipynb
  - trees.dib
  - ...

  Some notebooks may be dedicated to an entire problem. Otherwise I will attempt to name problems in a notebook with the naming scheme `00 Name1`, `01 Name2`... etc.
  > **Note:** Notebooks can render an [`HtmlString`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.html.htmlstring) object in the output of the cell. It might be fun to define some .NET types in a dll that provide an `HtmlString` in some fashion and import them into a notebook. Therefore, this may affect the project structure and whether certain notebooks can run without colocated dependencies in the future.
